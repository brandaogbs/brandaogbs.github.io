I take things apart and assemble them back together. 
I hold a BSc. and MSc. in Electrical Engineering from the State University of Londrina (UEL). Currently working as Embedded Tech Lead at V3. 
I am passionate about embedded systems and relish working on challenging problems and diving into complex code bases. 
I also never play zero-sum relationships. Usually involved with embedded Linux/Android, microcontrollers, real‐time programming, telemetry, computer vision, processor architecture, and electronic instrumentation.
