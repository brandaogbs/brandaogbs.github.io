Grateful for the remarkable individuals I've crossed paths withâ€”those who dragged me from the depths of my own foolishness, forged links to other worthy minds, and offered counsel when I teetered on the edge. They pulled me from mediocrity and pushed me toward something greater.

<hr>
May the knowledge they've shared ripple outward, a silent legacy, and a tribute in their name.

<hr>
Keep this in mind: I crave *more*, I strive for *more*, and *more* will never be enough.
